/*

Day 1: Variables, Data Types, and Basic Output
- Practice declaring variables with var, let, const
- Work with numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined
- Use console.log for output
- Write simple programs: print values, swap numbers, add/subtract

Day 2: Conditional Statements and Operators
- Practice if, else if, else, switch
- Use comparison operators (==, ===, >, <, !=, <=, >=)
- Use logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Write programs: check even/odd, grade checker, voting age, largest of two numbers

Day 3: Loops and Core Patterns
- Practice for, while, do-while loops
- Use loops to print numbers, sum numbers, multiplication tables
- Loop through arrays (using index, not forEach)
- Write programs: reverse a string/number, count vowels, find max/min in array

Day 4: Arrays and Objects (No built-in methods)
- Create and access arrays and objects
- Add/remove elements manually (using index)
- Loop through arrays and objects with for/while
- Write programs: merge arrays, find duplicates, frequency count, simple user profile

Day 5: Functions and Problem Solving
