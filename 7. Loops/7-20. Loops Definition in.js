/* Loops :

The Repetition of code is called Loop 
and each repetition is called iteration in another words, 
running the same lines of code for a certain number of times
is called Loop. */

/*
JS offers you two Loops 
While Loop and For Loop 

when you know, how many times your loop needs to iterate then you can use For Loop
When you have the kind of loop where you need to stop the loop based on
certain condition, you can us While Loop.*/
