// Higher order functions :
/**
 * A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument,
 * or returns a function as a result.
 * Examples include:
 * - Array methods like map, filter, and reduce
 * - Functions that create other functions
 * - Functions that accept callbacks
 * Higher-order functions allow for more abstract and reusable code.
 * They can be used to create more complex operations by combining simpler functions.
 * They are a key feature of functional programming in JavaScript.
 * Basically, they allow you to treat functions as first-class citizens, enabling powerful patterns like function composition, currying, and partial application.
