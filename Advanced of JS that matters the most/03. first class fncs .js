// First Class Functions ::
/*
 * In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens. This means that functions can be treated like any other value.
 * They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.
 * This allows for powerful programming techniques such as:
 * - Function composition
 * - Higher-order functions
 * - Callbacks
 * - Closures
 * First-class functions enable a functional programming style in JavaScript, making it easier to write modular and reusable code.
